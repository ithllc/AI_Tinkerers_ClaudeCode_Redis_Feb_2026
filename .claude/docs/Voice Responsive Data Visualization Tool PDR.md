# Voice Responsive Data Visualization Tool PDR

# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

1\. Executive Summary  
The "VoxVisual" tool allows users to perform hands-free data analysis. It transforms spoken queries into high-fidelity, animated SVG visualizations. Unlike static dashboards, the UI is ephemeral and generated on-demand, using Redis to maintain a "conversational memory" of the data exploration.  
2\. User Personas  
The Busy Executive: Needs quick insights while multitasking; uses voice to "ask" for trends.  
The Field Engineer: Uses hands-free commands to visualize sensor data on a tablet while working on equipment.  
3\. Functional Requirements  
FR1: Audio Stream Handling: Capture user voice, convert to text, and detect "intent."  
FR2: Generative SVG UI: Generate valid React/SVG code that includes \<animate\> or CSS keyframe animations.  
FR3: Stateful Analysis: Maintain a history of queries in Redis (e.g., "Zoom in on that" refers to the previous chart).  
FR4: Audio Feedback: Read back insights using Text-to-Speech (TTS).  
4\. User Experience (UX) Goals  
Zero-Latency Feel: Use "loading" animations generated by the previous state while the next UI is being built.  
Visual Continuity: SVGs should morph or transition smoothly between data states.
